# Corrupt

My first attempt at using the [Regolith](https://github.com/reachingisaskill/regolith/tree/release) backend.

I'm a programmer not an artist so I'm just throwing things together to see how it works, what needs improving, etc.


## Story

You are corruption. Whatever soul you thought you had is just black, tar-like mess. Whatever sins your life contained has reduced you to this existance in what can only be described as hell.
But for some reason you fight it.

Battle your way through other currupted souls in a barren and hazardous hell. Maybe there's even a way out...


## Notes

Yeh its a little cheesy, but most sprites will be black blobs so it *should* be easy to draw. We'll find out.
Stay tuned.
